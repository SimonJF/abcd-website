General points
======

* Effort to participate shouldn't be too onerous
* Implementation work to be done in advance of the event
* De-emphasise 1980s internet protocols (boring, unrepresentative).
  Emphasise the wide variety of potential applications. For example:
  games. Ornela suggested EasyChair.
* Presentations should take the form of demos (of running applications,
  type systems, etc)
* What did the session type "world view" bring to the problem?
* Discuss what was easy, what was hard

Basic structure of event
======

Idea #1
------

* We define several "challenge" problems, ranging from easy to hard
* Issue challenge problems 1 month before the event
* Each participating team solves what they can of the challenges

Con: 15 solutions to the same problem will get boring quickly.

Idea #2
------

* Every participating team presents one or more example applications of
  their own choosing

Con: inherently less comparative.

Idea #3 (somewhere between #1 and #2)
------

* Solicit challenge problems from the participants, providing several of our own too
* People can submit problems they know they can easily solve
* Curate the submitted problems into a uniform format
* Then as #1

Con: similar weakness to #1, mitigated somewhat by having more challenge
problems (less overlap on the day).

What we want to accomplish
======

We should be clear from the outset about what we want to learn from this
exercise. For example:

* What's easy (or hard) with particular languages/approaches?
* What is the state of the art in static (and dynamic) protocol-checking?
* What are the main obstacles to rollig out session types to real world languages?
* Do session types suggest new kinds of language?

More specific issues:

* How might dependent types fit in?
* Practical issues relating to expressivity (sync vs. async, binary vs. multiparty)
* Interaction with specific language features, e.g. exceptions
* Inference vs. type checking
* Global type synthesis vs. projection

Details to work out
======

* Name for event
* How long each presentation? (CoCo was 10-15 min; maybe 30 min inc. discussion)
* Can we fill all the presentation slots (potentially 18)
* What could we fill the time with otherwise?
* Are there any potential research outputs?
* Run initial plan past Sam for feedback
* Get basic plan in place _before_ discussing with Simon/Phil in London
* Give an outline of the event at ABCD meeting on 19 April
* Contact https://www.rgu.ac.uk/dmstaff/mccall-john re. SICSA assistance

Tentative Schedule

Similar for day 2. Possibly more discussion time if we don't have enough presentations.

Event name
======

Assuming we want to follow the usual convention of using a 3-6 letter
acronym for the event, here's a set of words we might like to choose from:

>> *A*pplied
>> *A*spects
>> *B*ehavioural
>> *C*ommunication
>> *C*oncurrency
>> *D*istribution
>> *I*mplementation
>> *L*anguages
>> *P*ractical
>> *P*ractice
>> *P*rogramming
>> *S*ession
>> *T*ypes

Some ideas:

Corny idea | Short for
---        | ---
PSST       | *P*ractical *S*ystems for *S*ession *T*ypes
STIPL      | *S*ession *T*ypes *i*n *P*ractical *L*anguages
PAST       | *P*ractical *A*spects of *S*ession *T*ypes
