Action Items
======

* Roly to update README with themes.
* Garrett to start website.

Organisers
======

Garrett Morris (garrett.morris@ed.ac.uk) and Roly Perera (roly.perera@glasgow.ac.uk)

Introduction
======

* Session types have the potential to transform how we build
  distributed, concurrent systems
* Lots of interesting theoretical work has been done, and several research languages implemented
* Mainstream adoption remains negligible to zero
* Now would be a good time to take stock of where we are in terms of
  adding session types to practical languages

General points
======

* Effort to participate should not be too onerous
* Implementation work to be done in advance of the event
* De-emphasise 1980s internet protocols (boring, unrepresentative).
  Emphasise the wide variety of potential applications. Random example:
  games. Ornela suggested EasyChair.
* Presentations should take the form of demos (running applications,
  type systems, IDE plug-ins, ...)
* What did the session type "world view" bring to the problem?
* Discuss what was easy, what was hard

Themes
======

We invite tool or compiler demos and workshop-style talks on any of the
following topics:

**Dependent session types**
-----

**Interaction with specific language features**, such as exceptions and
  algebraic effects.

**Dynamic vs. static typing.**

We originaly considered posing "challenge" problems and inviting each
participating team to solve what they could of the challenges. We
decided this would lead to repetition on the day, and would require a
fair amount of coordination prior to the event.

Idea #3 (somewhere between #1 and #2)
------

* Solicit challenge problems from the participants, providing several of our own too
* People can submit problems they know they can easily solve
* Curate the submitted problems into a uniform format
* Then as #1

Con: similar weakness to #1, mitigated somewhat by having more challenge
problems (less overlap on the day).

What we want to accomplish
======

What is the point of the exercise? Let's be clear about this from the outset. For example:

* What's easy (or hard) with particular languages/approaches?
* What is the state of the art in static (and dynamic) protocol-checking?
* What are the main obstacles to rolling out session types to real world languages?
* Do session types suggest new kinds of language?

More specific issues:

* Practical issues relating to expressivity (sync vs. async, binary vs. multiparty)
* Inference vs. type checking; global type synthesis vs. projection

Details to work out
======

* Name for event
* How long each presentation? (Maybe 30 min with discussion; CoCo was 10-15 min)
* Can we fill all the presentation slots (potentially 18)
* What could we fill the time with otherwise?
* Are there any potential research outputs?
* Run initial plan past Sam for feedback
* Get basic plan in place _before_ discussing with Simon/Phil in London
* Outline the event at ABCD meeting on 19 April
* Contact https://www.rgu.ac.uk/dmstaff/mccall-john re. SICSA assistance

Tentative Schedule
======

Schedule question: How long should periods be?
* ICFP - 50 minutes, 2 x 25 minute sessions
* Everything else - 90 minutes, 3 x 30 minute sessions
* ESOP - 120 minutes, 4 x 30 minute sessions
* CoCo - x 10
Should 'demos' and 'talks' have the same amount of time?

Event name
======

Assuming we want to follow the usual convention of using a 3-6 letter
acronym for the event, here's a set of words we might like to choose from:

>> *A*pplied
>> *A*spects
>> *B*ehavioural
>> *C*aledonian
>> *C*olloquium
>> *C*ommunication
>> *C*omputation
>> *C*oncrete
>> *C*oncerns
>> *C*oncurrency
>> *D*istribution
>> *I*mplementation
>> *L*anguages
>> *P*ractical
>> *P*ractice
>> *P*rogramming
>> *S*ession
>> *T*ypes

Some ideas:
