Event goals
======

The blockquote below contains the draft website content.

>> CoCoPoP
>> ======

>> **8-9 June, 2015. School of Computing Science, University of Glasgow**

>> Behavioural types, such as session types, have the potential to
>> transform how we build distributed, concurrent systems. Theoretical
>> progress continues apace, but the impact thus far on real-world
>> systems has been minimal.

>> The aim of this colloquium is to explore the interface between
>> session types and practical programming. By examining the state of
>> the art, we hope to shed light on the strengths and weaknesses of
>> existing approaches, identify obstacles to adoption, and highlight
>> the challenges of integrating with existing programming models and
>> language features. The primary focus on the event will be tool and
>> compiler demonstrations, but we also welcome workshop-style talks on
>> related issues.

>> Themes
>> ------

>> We solicit demos or informal talks (demos preferred) on any topic
>> that fits within the overall focus of the colloquium. The following
>> areas are of particular interest, but feel free to surprise us.
>> Theoretical content is welcome as long as its relevance to
>> programming practice is made clear.

>> **Dependent session types**. Value-dependency in protocols is common:
     an SMTP session for example starts with a negotiation of buffer
     sizes and features supported by the server. Relatedly, what kind of
     protocols is it possible to encode in advanced type systems like
     those of Agda or Haskell? How expressive are Idris protocols,
     compared to session types?

>> **Interaction with specific language features**, such as exceptions,
     transactions, and other effects.

>> **Dynamic vs. static typing.** Gradual and dynamic session typing.

>> **Unfamiliar application areas** that showcase the wide applicability
     of behavioural types. Possible ideas include computer games; online
     knowledge-sharing engines such as Stack Exchange; workflow systems
     such as EasyChair. Examples of common architectures or system
     designs that are not easily captured by existing behavioural type
     systems are also of interest.

>> **IDE and editor features** specific to languages with behavioural
     typing, such as type-directed code completion and syntax
     highlighting; meaningful error messages; and debugging and runtime
     monitoring.

>> **Type inference, type synthesis and type abstraction** techniques
     that check that programs are consistent without requiring the
     programmer to write out onerous types in full.

>> **Behavioural types and objects.** Formal session calculi are often
     based on pi calculus, but real-world interactive systems are mostly
     object-oriented.

Discarded ideas
------

An earlier idea was to pose "challenge" problems and invite each
participating team to present solutions to several of these. This would
probably lead to repetition on the day; it would also require some
lead-time and coordination prior to the event. Allowing the participants
to propose the challenge problems would mitigate the problem of
potential repetition, but require even more lead-time and coordination
ahead of the event. Either variant also involves additional work for
participants, which might discourage submissions.

Better to take things one step at a time: first an event emphasising
programming over theory. If that is a success, we can think about a
follow-up event with a less conventional (and more explicitly
comparative) structure.

What we want to accomplish
======

Other specific issues:

* sync vs. async
* binary vs. multiparty

Programme
======

Schedule questions:

* How long should each session be?
* Should 'demos' and 'talks' have the same amount of time?

Some reference points:

* ICFP - 50 minutes (2 x 25 min)
* ESOP - 120 minutes (4 x 30 min)
* CoCo - 75 minutes (5 x 15 min)
* Typical conference - 90 minutes (3 x 30 min)

>> *A*pplied
>> *A*spects
>> *B*ehavioural
>> *C*aledonian
>> *C*olloquium
>> *C*ommunication
>> *C*omputation
>> *C*oncrete

>> *L*anguages
>> *P*ractical
>> *P*ractice
>> *P*rogramming
>> *S*eminar
>> *S*ession
>> *S*ystems
>> *T*ypes

Some possibilities:
