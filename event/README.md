Event goals
======

The blockquote below contains the draft website content.

>> CoCoPoP
>> ======

>> **8-9 June, 2015. School of Computing Science, University of Glasgow**

>> Behavioural types, such as session types, have the potential to
>> transform how we build distributed, concurrent systems. Theoretical
>> progress continues apace, but the impact thus far on real-world
>> systems has been minimal.

>> The aim of this colloquium is to explore the interface between
>> session types and practical programming. We hope to generate insight
>> into the strengths and weaknesses of existing approaches, identify
>> obstacles to adoption, and discuss technical issues surrounding
>> integration with existing programming models and language features.
>> The primary focus on the event will be tool and compiler
>> demonstrations, but we also welcome workshop-style talks on related
>> issues.

>> Themes
>> ------

>> We solicit demos or informal talks on any topic that fits within the
>> overall focus of the colloquium. The following topics are of
>> particular interest, but feel free to surprise us. Theoretical
>> content is welcome as long as its relevance to programming practice
>> is made clear.

>> **Dependent session types**, including

>> **Interaction with specific language features**, such as exceptions,
>>  transactions, and algebraic effects.

>> **Dynamic vs. static typing.**

>> **Unfamiliar application areas** that showcase the wide applicability
     of behavioural types. Random ideas: computer games; online
     knowledge-sharing engines such as StackOverflow; workflow systems
     such as EasyChair. Examples of common architectures or system
     designs that are not readily captured by existing behavioural type
     systems are also welcome.

>> **IDE and editor features** that support session types, such as
     type-directed code completion, highlighting, and error messages.

>> **Type inference and synthesis** approaches that check that programs
     are consistent without requiring the programmer to write out
     onerous types in full.

>> **Behavioural types and objects.** Formal session calculi are often
     based on pi calculus, but real-world interactive systems are mostly
     object-oriented.

Discarded ideas
------

An earlier idea was to pose "challenge" problems and invite each
participating team to present solutions to several of these. This would
probably lead to repetition on the day; it would also require some
lead-time and coordination prior to the event. Allowing the participants
to propose the challenge problems would mitigate the problem of
potential repetition, but require even more lead-time and coordination
ahead of the event. Either variant also involves additional work for
participants, which might discourage submissions.

Better to take things one step at a time: first an event emphasising
programming over theory. If that is a success, we can think about a
follow-up event with a less conventional (and more explicitly
comparative) structure.

What we want to accomplish
======

* What is the state of the art in static (and dynamic) protocol-checking?

More specific issues:

* Practical issues relating to expressivity (sync vs. async, binary vs. multiparty)

Programme
======

Schedule question: How long should periods be?

* ICFP - 50 minutes (2 x 25 min)
* ESOP - 120 minutes (4 x 30 min)
* CoCo - 75 minutes (5 x 15 min)
* Typical conference - 90 minutes (3 x 30 min)

Should 'demos' and 'talks' have the same amount of time?

We will follow the familiar, if predictable, convention of using a 3-7
letter acronym for the event. Here's a set of suitable words:

>> *A*pplied
>> *A*spects
>> *B*ehavioural
>> *C*aledonian
>> *C*olloquium
>> *C*ommunication
>> *C*omputation
>> *C*oncrete
>> *C*oncerns
>> *C*oncurrency

>> *L*anguages
>> *P*ractical
>> *P*ractice
>> *P*rogramming
>> *S*eminar
>> *S*ession
>> *S*ystems
>> *T*ypes

Some possibilities:
