Event goals
======

The blockquote below contains the draft website content.

>> CoCoPoP
>> ======

>> **8-9 June, 2015. School of Computing Science, University of Glasgow**

>> Behavioural types, such as session types, have the potential to
>> transform how we build distributed, concurrent systems. Theoretical
>> progress continues apace, but the impact thus far on real-world
>> systems has been minimal.

>> The aim of this colloquium is to explore the interface between
>> session types and practical programming. We hope to generate insight
>> into the strengths and weaknesses of existing approaches, identify
>> obstacles to practical adoption, and discuss technical issues
>> surrounding integration with existing programming models and language
>> features. The primary focus on the event will be tool and compiler
>> demonstrations, but we also welcome workshop-style talks on related
>> issues.

>> Themes
>> ------

>> We solicit demos or informal talks on any topic that fits within the
>> overall focus of the colloquium. The following topics are of
>> particular interest, but feel free to surprise us. Theoretical
>> content is welcome as long as its relevance to programming practice
>> is made clear.

>> **Dependent session types**, including

>> **Interaction with specific language features**, such as exceptions,
>>  transactions, and algebraic effects.

>> **Dynamic vs. static typing.**

>> **Unfamiliar application areas** that showcase the wide applicability
     of behavioural types. Random ideas: computer games; online
     knowledge-sharing engines such as StackOverflow; workflow systems
     such as EasyChair. Examples of common architectures or system
     designs that are not readily captured by existing behavioural type
     systems are also welcome.

>> **IDE and editor features** that support session types, such as
     type-directed code completion, highlighting, and error messages.

Discarded ideas
------

We considered posing "challenge" problems and inviting each
participating team to present solutions to one or more of these. This
would probably lead to repetition on the day, and require a fair amount
of coordination prior to the event. Allowing the participants to propose
the challenge problems would mitigate the problem of potential
repetition, but require even more coordination and lead-time prior to
the event. Moreover the effort involved in participating should not be
onerous.

We decided to take things one step at a time: first an event emphasising
practices and programming. If that is a success, we can think about a
follow-up event with a less conventional (and more explicitly
comparative) structure.

What we want to accomplish
======

* What is the state of the art in static (and dynamic) protocol-checking?
* What are the main obstacles to rolling out session types to real world languages?
* Do session types suggest new kinds of language?

More specific issues:

* Practical issues relating to expressivity (sync vs. async, binary vs. multiparty)
* Inference vs. type checking; global type synthesis vs. projection

Details to work out
======

* Run initial plan past Sam for feedback
* Get basic plan in place _before_ discussing with Simon/Phil in London
* Outline the event at ABCD meeting on 19 April
* Contact https://www.rgu.ac.uk/dmstaff/mccall-john re. SICSA assistance

Programme
======

Schedule question: How long should periods be?

* ICFP - 50 minutes (2 x 25 min)
* ESOP - 120 minutes (4 x 30 min)
* CoCo - 75 minutes (5 x 15 min)
* Typical conference - 90 minutes (3 x 30 min)

Should 'demos' and 'talks' have the same amount of time?

Event name
======

We will follow the usual if predictable convention of using a 3-7 letter
acronym for the event. Here's a set of suitable words:

>> *A*pplied
>> *A*spects
>> *B*ehavioural
>> *C*aledonian
>> *C*olloquium
>> *C*ommunication
>> *C*omputation
>> *C*oncrete
>> *C*oncerns
>> *C*oncurrency
>> *D*istribution
>> *I*mplementation
>> *L*anguages
>> *P*ractical
>> *P*ractice
>> *P*rogramming
>> *S*eminar
>> *S*ession
>> *S*ystems
>> *T*ypes

Some possibilities:
