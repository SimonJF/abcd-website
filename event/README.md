>> Practical Aspects of Session Types
>> ======

>> **8-9 June, 2015**
>> **School of Computing Science, University of Glasgow**

>> Session types and other forms of behavioural type system have the
>> potential to transform how we build distributed, concurrent systems.
>> Theoretical progress continues apace, but adoption in real-world
>> languages remains negligible. The aim of this colloquium is to take
>> stock of where we are in terms of adding session types to practical
>> languages. We also welcome workshop-style talks on related issues.

>> We hope to achieve shared insight into the strengths and weaknesses
>> of existing approaches, obstacles to practical adoption, and the
>> technical issues surrounding integration with existing programming
>> models.

>> Themes
>> ------

>> We invite tool or compiler demos and workshop-style talks on any of the
>> following topics:. Theoretical content is welcome but

>> **Dependent session types**
>> -----

>> **Interaction with specific language features**, such as exceptions and
>>  algebraic effects.

>> **Dynamic vs. static typing.**

We originally considered posing "challenge" problems and inviting each
participating team to solve what they could of the challenges. We
decided this would lead to repetition on the day, and would also require
a fair amount of coordination prior to the event.

Another variant we considered (slightly closer to the current plan) was
to solicit challenge problems from the participants, providing several
of our own too. This would somewhat mitigate the problem of potential
repetition, since people would be able toÃ± submit problems that
showcased their particular tool or language. Still, this requires a
certain amount of coordination/lead-time prior to the event to curate
the submitted problems into a uniform format.
* Then as #1

Con: similar weakness to #1, mitigated somewhat by having more challenge
problems (less overlap on the day).



General points
======

* De-emphasise 1980s internet protocols (boring, unrepresentative).
  Emphasise the wide variety of potential applications. Random example:
  games. Ornela suggested EasyChair.
* Presentations should take the form of demos (running applications,
  type systems, IDE plug-ins, ...)
* What did the session type "world view" bring to the problem?
* Discuss what was easy, what was hard

Idea #3 (somewhere between #1 and #2)
------

What we want to accomplish
======

What is the point of the exercise? Let's be clear about this from the outset. For example:

* What's easy (or hard) with particular languages/approaches?
* What is the state of the art in static (and dynamic) protocol-checking?
* What are the main obstacles to rolling out session types to real world languages?
* Do session types suggest new kinds of language?

More specific issues:

* Practical issues relating to expressivity (sync vs. async, binary vs. multiparty)
* Inference vs. type checking; global type synthesis vs. projection

Details to work out
======

* Run initial plan past Sam for feedback
* Get basic plan in place _before_ discussing with Simon/Phil in London
* Outline the event at ABCD meeting on 19 April
* Contact https://www.rgu.ac.uk/dmstaff/mccall-john re. SICSA assistance

Programme
======

Schedule question: How long should periods be?

* ICFP - 50 minutes (2 x 25 min)
* ESOP - 120 minutes (4 x 30 min)
* CoCo - 75 minutes (5 x 15 min)
* Typical conference - 90 minutes (3 x 30 min)

Should 'demos' and 'talks' have the same amount of time?

Event name
======

We will follow the usual if predictable convention of using a 3-7 letter
acronym for the event. Here's a set of suitable words:

>> *A*pplied
>> *A*spects
>> *B*ehavioural
>> *C*aledonian
>> *C*olloquium
>> *C*ommunication
>> *C*omputation
>> *C*oncrete

>> *L*anguages
>> *P*ractical
>> *P*ractice
>> *P*rogramming
>> *S*eminar
>> *S*ession
>> *S*ystems
>> *T*ypes

Some possibilities:
