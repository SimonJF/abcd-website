*** Basic structure of event

** Idea #1

* We define 1 or more "challenge" problems, ranging from easy to hard
* We issue the challenge problems say 1 month before the event
* Each participating team solves what they can of the challenge problems
* Presentation discusses what was easy, what was hard

** Idea #2

* Every participating team presents one or more example applications
* Presentation showcases advantage of their system, but also discusses weaknesses

** Idea #3 (somewhere between #1 and #2)

* Solicit challenge problems from the participants
* As organisers, curate the submitted problems into a representative set
* Announce these 1 month in advance of the event
* Each participating team then solves what they can of the challenge problems

General points:

* Work involved shouldn't be too burdensome
* Implementation work all done in advance of the event
* Emphasise applications other than 1980s internet protocols. For
  example: games. Ornela suggested EasyChair.

*** Details to work out

* Name for event
* What we want to accomplish
* How to keep barrier to entry low (less scientific, more fun)
* How long each presentation? (CoCo was 10-15 min; maybe 30 min inc. discussion)
* Can we fill all the presentation slots (potentially 18)
* What could we fill the time with otherwise?
* Are there any potential research outputs?
* Let's run past Sam for feedback
* Get basic setup in place _before_ discussing with Simon/Phil in London
* Aim to have a provisional plan in place by ABCD meeting on 19 April
* Contact https://www.rgu.ac.uk/dmstaff/mccall-john re. SICSA assistance
