*** General points

* Work involved shouldn't be too onerous
* Implementation work to be done in advance of the event
* Emphasise applications other than 1980s internet protocols. For
  example: games. Ornela suggested EasyChair.

*** Basic structure of event

** Idea #1

* We define 1 or more "challenge" problems, ranging from easy to hard
* Issue the challenge problems 1 month before the event
* Each participating team solves what they can of the challenges
* Presentation discusses what was easy, what was hard

Con: will get boring quickly, if we have 15 presentations of solutions
to the same problem.

** Idea #2

* Every participating team presents one or more example applications of
  their own choosing
* Presentation showcases advantages of their system, but also discusses
  weaknesses

Con: inherently less comparative.

** Idea #3 (somewhere between #1 and #2)

* Solicit challenge problems from the participants, providing several of our own too
* Curate the submitted problems into a coherent set
* Then proceed as #1

Con: similar weakness to #1, possibly somewhat mitigated by having lots
of challenge problems.

*** What we want to accomplish

Make these clear from the outset. We'd like to discover:

* What's easy/hard with particular languages/approaches?
* How might dependent types fit in? (cf. Agda/Idris)
* Something about static vs. dynamic typing?
* What are the main obstacles to having session types in real world languages?
* Do session types suggest new kinds of language?

More specific issues:

* Practical issues relating to expressivity (sync vs. async, binary vs. multiparty)
* Interaction with other language features, e.g. exceptions
* Inference vs. type checking
* Global type synthesis vs. projection

*** Details to work out

* Name for event
* How to keep barrier to entry low (less scientific, more fun)
* How long each presentation? (CoCo was 10-15 min; maybe 30 min inc. discussion)
* Can we fill all the presentation slots (potentially 18)
* What could we fill the time with otherwise?
* Are there any potential research outputs?
* Let's run past Sam for feedback
* Get basic setup in place _before_ discussing with Simon/Phil in London
* Aim to have a provisional plan in place by ABCD meeting on 19 April
* Contact https://www.rgu.ac.uk/dmstaff/mccall-john re. SICSA assistance
