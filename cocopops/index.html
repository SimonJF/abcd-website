    <h2>Practical Programming with Session Types</h2>

    <p> Behavioural types, such as session types, have the potential to transform how we build
      distributed, concurrent systems. Theoretical progress continues apace, but the impact on
      real-world systems has thus far been minimal.

    <p>The aim of this colloquium is to explore the nascent frontier where session types meet
      practical programming. By examining the state of the art, we hope to shed light on the
      strengths and weaknesses of existing approaches, identify obstacles to adoption, and explore
      the challenges of integration with existing programming models. We are particularly eager for
      submissions of tool and compiler demonstrations, but also welcome workshop-style talks on
      related issues.

    <h2>Themes</h2>


    <p> We solicit demos and talks on any topic that fits within the overall focus of the
      colloquium. The following areas are of particular interest, but feel free to surprise us.
      Theoretical content is welcome as long as its relevance to programming practice is made clear.

    <ul>
      <li> <b>Dynamic vs. static typing.</b> Languages with gradual or dynamic behavioural
        typing. Application domains where static typing is impractical or where parts of the
        protocol are hard to enforce statically.

      <li> <b>Dependent session types.</b> Value-dependency in protocols is common: an SMTP session,
        for example, starts with a negotiation of buffer sizes and features supported by the server.
        How do advanced type systems, like those of Agda or Haskell, improve the expressivity of
        session types.  How expressive are Idris protocols, compared to session types?

      <li> <b>Binary and multiparty session types.</b> Multiparty session types provide safety and
        termination guarantees that cannot be expressed by a web of binary sessions. However, work
        on logical foundations for session types, as well as some implementations, have focused
        exclusively on the binary case.  Can these approaches be adapted to multiparty session
        types?  Do multiparty session types have a logical interpretation?

      <li><b>Interaction with other language features,</b> such as exceptions, and other effects;
        transactions and error recovery; concurrency features like actors and futures.

      <li><b>Unfamiliar application areas</b> that showcase the wide applicability of behavioural
        types. Possible ideas include computer games; online knowledge-sharing engines such as Stack
        Exchange; workflow systems such as EasyChair. Systems not easily captured by existing
        behavioural type systems are also of interest.

      <li><b>IDE and editor features</b> specific to behavioural typing, such as type-directed code
        completion and syntax highlighting; meaningful error messages; debugging and runtime
        monitoring.

      <li><b>Type inference, type synthesis and type abstraction</b> techniques that check that
        programs are consistent without requiring the programmer to write out onerous types in full.
    </ul>
