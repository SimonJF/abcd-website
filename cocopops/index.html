    <h2>Practical Programming with Session Types</h2>

    <p> Theoretical work on session types and other forms of behavioural
      typing continues apace. Yet these ideas have gained little
      traction in practical languages outside the research
      community. What can we learn from the research languages that
      exist today?

    <p>At this two-day meeting, we plan to focus on the practicalities
      of programming with session types: strengths and weaknesses of
      existing approaches, potential obstacles to adoption, and
      integration with existing programming paradigms, such as
      functional and object-oriented programming. Tool and compiler
      demonstrations are of particular interest, but workshop-style
      talks on related issues are also welcome.

    <h2>Themes</h2>

    <p> Demo and talk proposals on any topic that fits within the
      overall focus are encouraged. The following are some things that
      we find interesting, but feel free to surprise us. Theoretical
      content is welcomed as long as its relevance to programming
      practice is made clear.

    <ul>
      <li><b>Interaction with other language features,</b> such as
        exceptions, and other effects; transactions and error recovery;
        concurrency paradigms like actors and futures.

      <li> <b>Dependent session types.</b> Value-dependency in protocols
        is common: an SMTP session, for example, starts with a
        negotiation of buffer sizes and features supported by the
        server. How do advanced type systems, like those of Agda or
        Haskell, improve the expressivity of session types? How do Idris
        protocols compare to session types?

      <li><b>Interesting application areas</b> that showcase the wide
        applicability of behavioural types. Possible ideas include
        computer games; online knowledge-sharing engines such as Stack
        Exchange; workflow systems such as EasyChair. Systems not easily
        captured by existing approaches are also of interest.

      <li><b>IDE and editor features</b> specific to behavioural typing,
        such as type-directed code completion and syntax highlighting;
        meaningful error messages; debugging and runtime monitoring.

      <li><b>Type inference, type synthesis and type abstraction</b>
        features that check that programs are consistent without
        requiring the programmer to write out onerous types in full.
    </ul>

   <p>CoCo:PoPS is organised by Garrett Morris, Dimitris Kouzapas and
   Roly Perera. If you are interested in attending or presenting, please
