* ESOP - 120 minutes (4 x 30 min)
* CoCo - 75 minutes (5 x 15 min)

Discarded ideas
======

An earlier idea was to pose "challenge" problems and invite each
participating team to present solutions to several of these. This would
probably lead to repetition on the day; it would also require some
lead-time and coordination prior to the event. Allowing the participants
to propose the challenge problems would mitigate the problem of
potential repetition, but require even more lead-time and coordination
ahead of the event. Either variant also involves additional work for
participants, which might discourage submissions.

Better to take things one step at a time: first an event emphasising
programming over theory. If that is a success, we can think about a
follow-up event with a less conventional (and more explicitly
comparative) structure.

Some possibilities:
