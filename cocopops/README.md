Discarded ideas
------

An earlier idea was to pose "challenge" problems and invite each
participating team to present solutions to several of these. This would
probably lead to repetition on the day; it would also require some
lead-time and coordination prior to the event. Allowing the participants
to propose the challenge problems would mitigate the problem of
potential repetition, but require even more lead-time and coordination
ahead of the event. Either variant also involves additional work for
participants, which might discourage submissions.

Better to take things one step at a time: first an event emphasising
programming over theory. If that is a success, we can think about a
follow-up event with a less conventional (and more explicitly
comparative) structure.

Programme
======

Schedule questions:

* How long should each session be?
* Should 'demos' and 'talks' have the same amount of time?

Some reference points:

* ICFP - 50 minutes (2 x 25 min)
* ESOP - 120 minutes (4 x 30 min)
* CoCo - 75 minutes (5 x 15 min)
* Typical conference - 90 minutes (3 x 30 min)

Event name
======

We will follow the familiar, if predictable, convention of using a 3-7
letter acronym for the event. Here's a set of suitable words:

>> *A*pplied
>> *A*spects
>> *B*ehavioural
>> *C*aledonian
>> *C*olloquium
>> *C*ommunication
>> *C*omputation
>> *C*oncrete
>> *C*oncerns
>> *C*oncurrency
>> *D*istribution
>> *I*mplementation
>> *L*anguages
>> *P*ractical
>> *P*ractice
>> *P*rogramming
>> *S*eminar
>> *S*ession
>> *S*ystems
>> *T*ypes

Some possibilities:
