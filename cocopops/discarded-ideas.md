Discarded ideas

An earlier idea was to pose "challenge" problems and invite each
participating team to present solutions to several of these. This would
probably lead to repetition on the day; it would also require some
lead-time and coordination prior to the event. Allowing the participants
to propose the challenge problems would mitigate the problem of
potential repetition, but require even more lead-time and coordination
ahead of the event. Either variant also involves additional work for
participants, which might discourage submissions.

Better to take things one step at a time: first an event emphasising
programming over theory. If that is a success, we can think about a
follow-up event with a less conventional (and more explicitly
comparative) structure.
